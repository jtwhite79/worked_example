Readme:

Listing of files included in the data release for "Towards reproducible environmental modeling for decision support: a worked example" by White and others, 2020.

In the working/_data directory are the aux supporting files

Files:

DRN_dict.csv - a listing of spring name, zero-indexed layer, zero-indexed row, and zero-indexed column, used for assigning meaningful names to simulated spring discharge
head_obs.crd - a PEST-style bore coordinates file of groundwater level observation locations during the history-matching simulation.  Fields are site name, X coordinate, Y coordinate, model layer
head_obs.crd.csv - a CSV file of history-matching simulation bore coordinate information with zero-indexed row and zero-indexed column.
pred_head_obs_sampled.smp - a PEST-style site sample file for groundwater level locations of interest during the scenario hindcast simulation which have been aligned to the simulation stress period ending dates.  Fields are site name, date, time, value.  Generated by eaa.py->_set_obsvals()  
pred_head_obs.crd - a PEST-style bore coordinates file of groundwater level observation locations during the history-matching simulation.  Fields are site name, X coordinate, Y coordinate, model layer
pred_head_obs.crd.csv - a CSV file of scenario simulation bore coordinate information with zero-indexed row and zero-indexed column.
pred_springflow_obs_sampled.smp - a PEST-style site sample file of scenario simulation spring discharge sampled to simulation stress period ending dates.  Fields are site name, date, time, value. Generated by eaa.py->_set_obsvals()  
pred_springflow_obs.smp - a PEST-style site sample file of scenario simulation spring discharge.  Fields are site name, date, time, value.
rch_zn_arr.dat - an integer array of shape nrow X ncol that enumerates unique recharge zones.  Generated by eaa.py->build_rch_zone_array()
reformatted_head_obs_sampled.smp - a PEST-style site sample file of history-matching simulation groundwater levels sampled to simulation stress period ending dates.  Fields are site name, date, time, value.  Generated by eaa.py->_set_obsvals()
reformatted_head_obs.smp - a PEST-style site sample file of history-matching simulation groundwate levels.  Fields are site name, date, time, value.
springflow_obs_samples.smp - a PEST-style site sample file of history-matching simulation spring discharge sampled to simulation stress period ending dates. Fields are site name, date, time, value.  Generated by eaa.py->_set_obsvals()
springflow_obs.smp - a PEST-style site sample file of history-matching simulation spring discharge. Fields are site name, date, time, value.
